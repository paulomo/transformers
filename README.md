Autobot vs Decepticons

To run the application you need to install 

1. RxSwift version ~> 5
2. RxCocoa version ~> 5
3. Alamofire version ~> 5
4. Swift 5

It not complete as I could not work during the weekend, I am still working on it though.

I tired to show how you can use both programmatic UI and storyboard in on application. Maybe in the near future I would SwiftUI when I am 
sure more people have started using it.
